Angular Shopping List Instructions

1) Replace the hardcoded shopping list with items retrieved from the mock REST endpoint: http://demo3374525.mockable.io/shopping-list
   There are no mock REST endpoints for adding or deleting items so just manage this data locally using the add and delete functions in the service
   (We’ll just pretend that we’re making server calls to persist the changes)

2) Add functionality to remove items from the shopping list

3) Add functionality to add new items to the shopping list

4) Add functionality to sort the items by name or type by clicking on the table header links

5) Add functionality to search (filter) by item or type name

6) Add pagination so that only 10 items are displayed on the page at a time
